<p> a) (2.5pt) Use JavaScript to implement the same functionality as you have done for 
  Lab 2 exercise d), which provides a text box and a button on the page. 
  The user can input an integer (the number should be larger than 0) in the text box and press the button, 
  then the web page prints all the integers from the given number to 1 except the those numbers that can 
  divide the given integer evenly. (For example, if the user input a number of 12, then the page prints 
  the result as “12,11,10,9,8,7,5,1”, because 12 can be divided evenly by 6,4,3,2. 
  Always output the number itself and the number 1).</p>
